		        WE ARE BACK IN THE YEAR 2020 TO BRING YOU A BRAND NEW RELEASE FOR GAME BOY COLOR, *BOUNCED GBC +5*!!!        NOW, A BIT OF INFO ON THE GAME ITSELF. THIS IS A GAME THAT *ALMOST* GOT A COMMERCIAL RELEASE; IT WAS FINISHED AND SENT TO NINTENDO FOR APPROVAL IN 2000, BUT NEVER ACTUALLY REACHED STORE SHELVES FOR SOME REASON. THE VERSION YOU ARE ABOUT TO PLAY IS THE VERY SAME VERSION THAT WAS SENT TO NINTENDO FOR APPROVAL. ENJOY!        THIS TRAINER ALSO INCLUDES A SMALL PATCH FOR THE GAME: IN THE ORIGINAL ROM, THE GAME WOULD FREEZE UPON COMPLETING LEVEL 31. NOT ANYMORE!        BY THE WAY, SHOUTOUTS TO SUPEROGUE/MQD^TREPAAN (CODE), MIRAGE/BD (GFX), AND RYO-OHKI (MUSIC) FOR MAKING THIS GAME!
